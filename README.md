# ReactNative Expo - Todo App

<strong> This is my first React Native Todo app to get started with React Native - Expo. </strong>

This App works like a normal Todo App and can do simple tasks by adding & deleting the tasks. Later I will add animation on this and add more facilities.

**List of Todos**
 - [x] Adding of task
 - [x] Deletion of task
 - [ ] Data persistence
 - [ ] Re-arraning tasks as per priority
 - [ ] **Animations & icons**

# Demo of the App
